# DeepNeuralNetworks-ActivationFunctions


This repository contains a Python implementation of a Deep Neural Networks and Activation Functions. The simulation software allows users to create a Deep Neural Networks and Activation Functions with customizable inputs, weights, biases, and activation functions. It includes training and testing functionalities .

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepNeuralNetworks-ActivationFunctions.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd  DeepNeuralNetworksAndActivationFunctions

3. Run the simulation script:
   
   ```bash
   python mainOne.py
   python mainTwo.py
   python mainThree.py 

5. Follow the prompts to input the number of inputs, weights, biases, and their respective values.
